      <h2>Compare Home Loan Interest Rates</h2>
      <p>
        Home loan offerings differ from different bank providers. Personal loan
        interest rates vary depending on a number of factors such as:
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Employment Type:</span> Personal loan interest rates differ for
        salaried and non-salaried personnel, considering non salaried personnel
        can pose risky investment possibilities
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Company Type:</span>Companies are organised into Category A, B and
        C based on parameters like revenue, adherence to standards and so on
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Salary:</span>Your salary dictates how much your interest rate
        could be. Lower salaries usually warrant higher interest rates to
        mitigate the banks lending risk
